# usingcalculatorwith_pyautogui
I have created a module that uses the mac calculator from inside IDLE shell. You input numbers and the programme will move the mouse to the corresponding numbers/operators on the calculator. The first thing the programme does is to open the calculator app and then you can start inputing numbers/operators until you type in = .
